0.13003 Sun 28 Jun 2015
  - Fix tests for newer perls
  - Note that this module isn't really maintained

0.13002 Wed 30 May 2007
  - Don't inherit from Exporter
  - Update POD tests

0.13001 Tue 22 May 2007
  - Actually append FastCalc in the libs for Math::BigInt
  - Remove execution bit from Makefile.PL

0.13
  - Fix typo in binary_search()

0.12 
  - Andreas Koenig and Tels have been kind enough to warn me of some
    problems with this family of modules. Some fundamental changes:
    - Use of '*_downgrade' is no longer an option. Everything is
      Math::BigInt or Math::BigFloat, otherwise things will get
      way too messy. In case we need real ints or whatever, we'll
      manually downgrade by doing ->as_number()->bstr()
  - Move to Module::Install.
  - Add Math::BigInt::FastCalc as an option to install as a backend
  - Fix mod(): At some point I ceased to use the Reignold & Dershowitz
    version of mod(), apparently. 
  - Change use case of floor() to POSIX::floor()

0.11 16 Jul 2006
  - Don't clone and set time zone when calculating moment. 
  - Don't call set() three times in truncate_to_midday.
  - Beef up moment tests
  - Add tests

0.10 16 Nov 2005
  - Add POD tests
  - Add POD

0.09 28 Jun 2005
  - fix mod(). somehow $bigint->bmod($mod) isn't working, so try using
    $bigint % $mod instead.

0.08 07 Jan 2005
  - It wasn't a bug. Handle it.
  - Fix Build.PL for MANIFEST

0.07 07 Jan 2005
  - Optimization for polynomial(0, ...)
  - Fixed something that might be a Math::BigInt bug.

0.06 07 Jan 2005
  - Fix Build.PL craziness trying to install things via CPAN

0.05 07 Jan 2005
  - Removed non-existent functions 'bi_upgrade' 'bf_upgrade'
    and replaced them with bigfloat() and bigint()
  - Fixed dt_from_moment(). 
  - rt #9478: Module::Build doesn't include Makefile.PL in MANIFEST
    so manually adding it.
  - No more memoizing

0.04 06 Jan 2005
  - Add revolution() and rev180() (Ronald Hill)
  - Require use of Math::BigInt / Math::BigFloat

0.03 25 Feb 2004
  - acos_deg() and asin_deg() were reporting incorrect results.
    Reported by Ronald Hill.

0.02 10 Feb 2004
  - Add prompts to install Math::BigInt::GMP and Math::BigInt::Pari on
    demand. 
  - Make underlying Math::BigFloat to fall back to Pari if loading GMP fails

0.01 12 Jan 2004
  - House cleaning
  - Minor tweaks

0.01_04 27 Dec 2003
  - Aah, bad bad. The DateTime object returned from rata_die() was set
    to a floating time zone. Yew. Now rata_die() is always in UTC
  - Introduce truncate_to_midday()
